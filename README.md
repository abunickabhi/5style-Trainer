Alg Trainer is a website that makes it easy to memorize Rubik's Cube algorithms. 

## Features

- [Giiker Smart Rubik's Cube support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PWErrApqWQ)
- Train algsets by their subsets - for example, you can train the T, U, L, Pi, H, S and AS subsets of ZBLL separately.
- Features a timer for timing your algorithms.
- Real scrambles - scrambles are not just the reverse of the algorithm. It won't be possible to guess the algorithm just by looking at the scramble!
- Pressing spacebar shows you the algorithm you should use. No more searching for algs in pdf documents!
